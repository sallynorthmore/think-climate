      I've pledged to make fairly bold changes to my lifestyle this year:
      - To eat a meatless diet (exceptions when I'm a guest)
      - Only rent electric cars (I mostly cycle)
      - To speak boldly about the climate
      - To vote for a Green New Deal

      Sarah Powell is a Senior Managing Consultant within IBM’s Energy,
      Environment & Utilities industry team in Europe. With a background in
      organisational change and transformation, Sarah’s goal is to develop
      cross-industry solutions, using exponential technologies such as
      Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Advanced Analytics, to
      challenge existing behaviours, ecosystems and business models, in the
      quest for cleaner, greener and more sustainable living.


      Sarah’s passion for sustainability was reinforced through her recent
      sabbatical to the America’s, where she witnessed the effects of plastic
      pollution and climate change first-hand. This passion is continuing to
      drive the future direction of her career. As a leader in this critical
      field, Sarah is currently developing IBM’s climate-related risk analysis
      and resilience offering and working with clients to accelerate their
      decarbonisation journey.
