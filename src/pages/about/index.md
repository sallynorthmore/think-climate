      Sophie Blank is a Digital Consultant for IBM iX. During her BSc and MSc in
      International Relations and War Studies, she focussed largely on the
      impact of climate change on migration and conflict. In the past, she
      volunteered for Unite 2030, an NGO empowering young leaders to develop
      solutions to the world’s biggest challenges, the United Nations SDGs.


      Sophie is particularly interested in sustainable investment. We, as
      individuals, can have an impact on what the future looks like by investing
      our money into a better world. It is an easy way of signalling to
      companies that change is needed to attract investments.

      Cecilia helps organisations understand the impact of weather on their
      business as the European Technical lead for IBM’s Weather Services. She
      gets particularly excited about opportunities to improve businesses’
      environmental footprints. She watched Al Gore speak about an Inconvenient
      Truth in Stockholm in 2004 which drove her decision to study Environmental
      Engineering. After graduating, she conducted flood risk assessments,
      looking at projections of sea level rise in the UK on a daily basis.
      Feeling there was more that could be done, she is at IBM to be part of a
      bigger community and to find out how technology can be part of the
      solution.
