      Sophie Blank is a Digital Consultant for IBM iX. During her BSc and MSc in
      International Relations and War Studies, she focussed largely on the
      impact of climate change on migration and conflict. In the past, she
      volunteered for Unite 2030, an NGO empowering young leaders to develop
      solutions to the world’s biggest challenges, the United Nations SDGs.


      Sophie is particularly interested in sustainable investment. We, as
      individuals, can have an impact on what the future looks like by investing
      our money into a better world. It is an easy way of signalling to
      companies that change is needed to attract investments. Find me on Instagram: [@annsophieblank](https://www.instagram.com/annsophieblank/) and Twitter:

      Anthony Huntley helps businesses to leverage weather and climate data in their business decisions to create value for their customers, society and shareholders. As IBM’s Leader for Weather Services & Analytics in the UK, he works with business in every industry, from leading food retailers, to F1 teams, to advance from hoping that weather is favourable for their business, to capitalising on whatever the weather brings. With IBM’s ‘The Weather Company’ and with the world’s leading weather data, he helps improve forecasts of renewable energy generation, minimise wastage with retailer demand forecasting, and help enhance precision agriculture techniques to increase yield to feed the world. As a founding member of the Global Climate Risk, Transition & Resilience offering, he helps companies to quantify their climate related financial risk, and how to minimise it; in the process, making companies much more conscious about what their own climate impact is, and how they can reduce it. Outside of work he loves to learn, get into nature and capture photos & drone videos of our incredible world.

      My pledge is to continue eat as a ‘Flexitarian’, reducing my red meat consumption (as it’s the worst offender in terms of negative carbon impact), live a ‘minimalist lifestyle’ to reduce my personal consumption carbon footprint, and help others find great resources helping address the climate crisis both inside IBM, and beyond.

      Cecilia helps organisations understand the impact of weather on their
      business as the European Technical lead for IBM’s Weather Services. She
      gets particularly excited about opportunities to improve businesses’
      environmental footprints. She watched Al Gore speak about an Inconvenient
      Truth in Stockholm in 2004 which drove her decision to study Environmental
      Engineering. After graduating, she conducted flood risk assessments,
      looking at projections of sea level rise in the UK on a daily basis.
      Feeling there was more that could be done, she is at IBM to be part of a
      bigger community and to find out how technology can be part of the
      solution.
